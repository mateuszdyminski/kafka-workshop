# Message Delivery Acknowledgement

From the official documentation in [Kafka as a Storage System](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/):

> Data written to Kafka is written to disk and replicated for fault-tolerance. Kafka allows producers to wait on acknowledgement so that a write isn't considered complete until it is fully replicated and guaranteed to persist even if the server written to fails.

Write a new Kafka producer that uses [ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG](https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerConfig.html#ACKS_CONFIG):

> The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete.

## Procedure

1. Read the official documentation about the [acks](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs) configuration property.
2. Configure a 3-broker Kafka cluster
3. Create a topic with one partition and the replication factor of 3
4. Write a Kafka producer `ProducerAcks` that uses the different levels of `acks`:
   1. `acks=0`
   2. `acks=1`
   3. `acks=all`
5. Observe their behaviour
6. How does `acks` relate to `min.insync.replicas` configuration property?
   "A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of "all". This will ensure that the producer raises an exception if a majority of replicas do not receive a write."
